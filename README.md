# NHS_tests
This is a small project I completed within an hour and a half to read screenshots I take of my blood tests from the NHS app. It reads all the screenshots, organises the information, and stores it in a pdf report and excel file. 

The motivation behind this is that I have been suffering from fibromyalgia, a tiring and chronic pain disorder, for 5+ years and I have recently started to see private doctors outside of the NHS frequently. This notebook helps to extract and organise all these tests in a readable format for non-NHS doctors. 

Remember, without health, you have nothing. Be careful and take care of yourself :)
